## ðŸš€ FG Office Wall

A quick mashup between airtable an Gatsby to try and create a lightweight virtual version of our office wall where we share pictures and interesting facts about each other.

Keep in mind the first iteration of this has been built by one of the mangement team - not a designer or developer. Ha! go easy.
